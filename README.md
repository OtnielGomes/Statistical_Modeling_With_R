# My learning with Statistics using the R language: Statistical Modeling With R
In this project I will work with statistical modeling using the R language.

# Database
The database will be Airq, in this database we will have some information about the air quality in the cities, some data on the amount of rain, coastal position of the cities, number of inhabitants, number of companies in the city and average income.
The objective of this project is to identify the reasons and factors that affect air quality in cities.
